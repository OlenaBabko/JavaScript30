        <h3>Carol of the Bells</h3>
        <p>Hark how the bells
          Sweet silver bells
          All seem to say
          Throw cares away
          Christmas is here
          Bringing good cheer
          To young and old
          Meek and the bold
          Ding-dong, ding-dong
          That is the song
          With joyful ring
          All caroling (Oh, oh, ah)
          One seems to hear
          Words of good cheer
          From everywhere (From everywhere)
          Filling the air
          Oh, how they pound (Oh, how they pound)
          Raising their sound
          O'er hill and dale
          Telling their tale
          Gaily they ring
          While people sing songs of good cheer
          Christmas is here
          Merry, Merry, Merry, Merry Christmas
          Merry, Merry, Merry, Merry Christmas
          On on they send
          On without end
          Their joyful tone
          To every home
          Ah, ah, ah
          Ding-dong, ding-dong
          Ding-dong, ding-dong
          Hark how the bells (Hark how the bells)
          Sweet silver bells
          All seem to say (All seem to say)
          Throw cares away
          (We will throw cares away)
          Christmas is here
          Bringing good cheer
          To young and old
          Meek and the bold
          Oh how they pound (Oh how they pound)
          Raising their sound
          O'er hill and dale
          Telling their tale
